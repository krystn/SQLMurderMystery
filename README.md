# SQL Murder Mystery
### 
This project is a SQL-based detective investigation using a fictional crime dataset. The goal was to solve a murder case that occurred on January 15, 2018 in SQL City, by analyzing various interconnected tables such as crime reports, personal records, gym memberships, and driver‚Äôs licenses.

### üß© Objective
Use SQL queries to:
- Investigate a murder case using the `crime_scene_report` table
- Identify and locate witnesses based on address clues
- Examine interview transcripts for critical information
- Cross-reference gym check-ins and membership records
- Match license plate details to narrow down the list of suspects
- Solve the case by identifying the murderer

### üîç Key SQL Concepts Used
- `INNER JOIN` to combine data across multiple tables
- `LIKE` and wildcards for partial string matching
- `ORDER BY` and `LIMIT` to isolate relevant data
- Filtering with multiple conditions using `WHERE` clauses
- Using IDs to trace relationships between people and records

### üß† Outcome
After piecing together clues from multiple tables, I identified Jeremy Bowers as the murderer. This involved:
- Tracking down two witnesses using address clues
- Reading their interview transcripts
- Investigating gym check-in data for suspects matching their descriptions
- Confirming suspect identity through license plate records
